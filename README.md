## 🔍 Overview

This project integrates a PyTorch-based SAC model into a Django-powered web interface. It simulates a multi-agent virtual economy of 200 players and 10 products, allowing real-time visualization of pricing decisions, reward progression, and CPI stability.

### Key Features
- Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) model for dynamic pricing optimization
- Simulation of 200 virtual players trading 10 in-game products
- Django backend with real-time visual interface
- Interactive dashboard powered by Chart.js
- CPI and reward trend tracking for economic stability analysis

> Note: This project is designed to run locally on `localhost`. Dashboard screenshots are included in the project poster.
